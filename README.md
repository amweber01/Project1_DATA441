# Project 1: Intro to Locally Weighted Regression

The main idea of linear regression is to make predictions as a weighted combination of the input feauture values where the weights can be positive or negative. As an equation, linear regression looks like:

$$\text{Predicted Value} = weight_1 \cdot \text{Feature}_1 + weight_2 \cdot \text{Feature}_2 + ... + weight_p \cdot \text{Feature}_p $$
